<b>What do I need to run mic1?</b>
<p>
Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 or later for Win95/98/NT or some flavor of
Unix.  There is not currently a distribution available for Macintosh.
<P>
Some of the java programs may be used in a text-only environment
(ijvmasm, mic1asm, mic1dasm, dump)
but the simulator itself and certain other programs 
(mic1sim, gijvmasm, gmic1asm) 
require a graphical environment.  
For Win95/98/NT users this should not a problem, but for Unix users, 
this means that you will need X-Windows to run the simulator or
GUI assemblers.
<P>
Also, for the Win95/98/NT distribution, you will need approximately 
700Kbytes of free disk space to do the install.   The Unix installation
requires about 600Kbytes.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="setup"></a>
<b>I've downloaded and installed mic1.  What do I need to do now?</b>
<p>
Before you run any of the mic1 software, you must set several environment
variables.
<ul>
<li><b>PATH</b>: The PATH environment variable must contain the directory
which has the JDK executables (java, javac, javadoc, etc).
<ul>
<li>Win95/98/NT: In a DOS shell, type <tt>path</tt> to view the PATH 
environment variable.  
For example:
<pre>
C:\>path
PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND
</PRE>
<P>
If the java bin directory is not in the PATH, 
you will need to add it to the path defined in <tt>env.bat</tt>.  
In the <TT>env.bat</TT> file you should add
<PRE>
path C:\JDK1.2\BIN;%PATH%
</pre>
<P>
where you would replace "C:\JDK1.2\" with the path of your JDK directory.  
<P>
If you don't know
the path of the JDK directory, select <b>Find-->Files or Folders... </b>from the
Start menu.  Enter "javac.exe" in the <b>Named</b> field.  Make sure the 
<b>Look in: </b> field indicates the correct drive, and the <b>Include 
subfolders</b> option is selected.  Click <b>Find Now</b>.  Set PATH as
the value in the <b>In Folder</b> column.  If no value appears, you do not have
a JDK installed.  If multiple values appear, you might have multiple JDK's
installed.  In this case, use any of the directories (preferably the directory
containing the newer JDK).
</p>
<li>Unix: At a command prompt, type <tt>echo $PATH</tt> to view PATH.
To add the java bin directory to the path, use one of the following commands,
depending on the command shell you are using.
<p>Bourne-compatable shell (sh, ksh, bash, zsh...)
<pre>
	export PATH=/usr/lib/jdk1.1/bin:$PATH
</pre>
</p>
<p>C shell-compatable shells (csh, tcsh)
<pre>
	set path=( /usr/lib/jdk1.1/bin $PATH )
</pre>
</ul>
<li><b>CLASSPATH</b>: The CLASSPATH variable indicates to the java utilities
where to look for .class files.  The CLASSPATH can contain any number of 
directories, .zip files, and .jar files.  
</ul>
<p>
<hr>

<b>
How do I use the I/O instructions, IN and OUT?
</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>IN</b>: When a key is pressed, the character entered is put into a
character buffer.  The <tt>IN</tt> instruction reads the next key from the
buffer and pushes its value onto the stack.  If the character buffer is 
empty, a value of 0 is pushed onto the stack.  The following is a method
that illustrates how to read a single character from a keyboard input.
<pre>
.method getchar()
start:	IN		// Read character from keyboard buffer
	DUP		// Duplicate char, one copy for comparison, one for return value
	IFEQ clear	// If char = 0 (keyboard buffer empty) goto clear
	IRETURN		// else, return with char as return value
clear:	POP		// Remove 0 from top of stack
	GOTO start	// Try reading character again
.end-method
</pre>
This method will loop until a key has been pressed.  The keyboard buffer
can be cleared by clicking the Reset button in the mic1sim window.  <tt>IN</tt>
does not echo characters to the standard out text area.  See <tt>echo.jas</tt>
for an example of how to echo key strokes to the standard out text area.
<li><b>OUT</b>: <tt>OUT</tt> prints the value on the top of the stack to
the standard out text area.
<pre>
	BIPUSH 0x48	// Push ASCII value for "H"
	OUT		// Print "H"
	BIPUSH 0x49	// Push ASCII value for "I"
	OUT		// Print "I"
</pre>
</ul>
<tt>IN</tt> and <tt>OUT</tt> use ASCII codes to represent keyboard characters.
See add.jas for examples of how to convert character strings into numeric
values.

<b>
How do I use methods in an IJVM program?
</b>
<p>
If you are using the included microprogram (mic1ijvm.mic1), the following
is the proper procedure for declaring and invoking a method in an IJVM
program.  To illustrate this, we will write a sample method called
<tt>DIFF_NEG_YN</tt>, which takes two parameters, calculates the difference,
prints "Y" if the difference is negative, "N" if positive, and sets as a
return value the difference.
<ol>
<li><b>Declare the method.</b>  Use the .method directive to name the 
method and any parameters.  Our example method is named <TT>DIFF_NEG_YN</tt>
and has two parameters, which we will name <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>.
Our method declaration would thus look like this:
<pre>
  .method DIFF_NEG_YN (p1,p2)
</pre>
The parameter list is comma-seperated.  The names in the list are automatically
declared as local variables and assigned the values passed to the method.
If a method takes no parameters, the method name should be followed by
empty parenthesis, ie, <tt> .method PRINT ()</tt>.
<li><b>Declare any local variables for the method.</b>
Use the <tt>.var</tt> and <tt>.end-var</tt> directives to declare
local variables.  For our example, we will declare a local variable
called <tt>diff</tt>
<pre>
  .var
  diff
  .end-var
</pre>
<li><b>Write the contents of the method.</b>
This is the program code for the method.  This code can access local variables
(parameters and locally declared variables), global constants (declared in the
<tt>.constant</tt> section of the program), and the local stack.  The 
invoked method has no means of accessing the stack or the local variables
of the invoking method.  Likewise, any jumps (GOTO, IFEQ, IFLT, IF_ICMPEQ)
can only happen within a method -- jumps between methods are not allowed.
Here is the code for our sample program:
<pre>
	ILOAD p1	// Push the first parameter
	ILOAD p2	// Push the second parameter
	SUB		// Subtract
	ISTORE diff	// Store the difference in diff
	ILOAD diff	// Push diff
	IFLT lt 	// If diff < 0, goto lt
	BIPUSH 0x4E	//  else, print "N"
	OUT
	GOTO return
lt:	BIPUSH 0x59	// (diff < 0)
	OUT		// print "Y"
return:	ILOAD diff  	// Push diff
	IRETURN		// Return (value of diff will be pushed onto the
			//  top of the invoking method's stack)

.end-method
</pre>
The method must end with the <tt>.end-method</tt> directive.  The IRETURN
instruction is necessary for the method to properly execute.

<li><b>Write the code for invoking the method.</b> These steps <i>must</i>
be followed to properly invoke a method.
<ol>
<li>Push OBJREF.  This may be any value.  For more information on OBJREF,
see chapter 4 of <u>Structured Computer Organization</u>.  In our example
program, we will push a constant called OBJREF, which was declared in the 
.constant section of the program.
<pre>
	LDC_W OBJREF
</pre>
<li>Push values that are to be method parameters <i>in the order they are
declared in the method declaration</i>.
<pre>
	BIPUSH 0x10
	BIPUSH 0x15
</pre>
When the method is called, p1 will be assigned the value 0x10 and p2 will
be assigned the value of 0x15.
<li>Invoke the method using <tt>INVOKEVIRTUAL</tt>
<pre>
	INVOKEVIRTUAL DIFF_NEG_YN
</pre>
<li>The return value of the method is on the top of the stack.  For our
example program, we will just ignore this value.
<pre>
	POP
</pre>
</ol>
</ol>
Here is the complete listing of our sample program
<pre>
// --- Start program ---

.constant 
OBJREF 0x10
.end-constant

.main
	LDC_W OBJREF
	BIPUSH 0x10
	BIPUSH 0x15
	INVOKEVIRTUAL DIFF_NEG_YN
	POP
	HALT
.end-main


.method DIFF_NEG_YN (p1,p2)

.var
diff
.end-var

	ILOAD p1	// Push the first parameter
	ILOAD p2	// Push the second parameter
	SUB		// Subtract
	ISTORE diff	// Store the difference in diff
	ILOAD diff	// Push diff
	IFLT lt 	// If diff < 0, goto lt
	BIPUSH 0x4E	//  else, print "N"
	OUT
	GOTO return
lt:	BIPUSH 0x59	// (diff < 0)
	OUT		// print "Y"
return:	ILOAD diff  	// Push diff
	IRETURN		// Return (value of diff will be pushed onto the
			//  top of the invoking method's stack)
.end-method

// --- End program ---

<A NAME="noecho"><B>Why doesn't keyboard input read by the IN 
instruction show up in "Standard out"?</B></A>
<P>
Because you <EM>might</EM> not want it to. The IN instruction 
reads from a device that is strictly an input device, 
and the OUT instruction writes to a device that is strictly an
output device.  If you want to display what the user is typing
while running your IJVM program,
you will need to cause this to happen by
doing an explicit OUT instruction for each character that you
read and want to echo.
<HR>

<A name="pcffffffff"><B>Why does the PC start at 0xFFFFFFFF instead of 
0x0?</B></A>
<P>
It seemed reasonable that the <EM>control store</EM> should begin
execution at control store location 0x000.  
This happens to be the location for the <TT>NOP</TT>
IJVM instruction, so we begin our interpretation loop there.  
We then 
proceed to "Main1" to increment the PC, 
and begin a fetch from this incremented address (the fetch happens
at the end of the clock cycle and the fetched value is not available
from MBR until the <EM>end</EM> of the next cycle).  Since
we want execution of the ISA-level program to begin at 0x00000000, we 
have accomplished this by pre-setting the PC to 0xFFFFFFFF and allowing
the initial increment along with an initial NOP, this "wastes" one 
micro-instruction every time we RESET the machine.
<P>
We <EM>could</EM> have used the same approach (with PC 0xFFFFFFFF) 
and started at "Main1"
instead of "nop1", in the <A HREF="mic1ijvm.mal"><TT>mic1ijvm.mal</TT></A> 
microprogram, 
but then we would have had to anchor "Main1" at
some particular location which would then have to be well-known to 
the "hardware" designers.  It seemed more reasonable to agree that
the first micro-instruction to be executed would always 
be the one at control store location 0x000 which is fine for 
the mic1ijvm interpreter, and probably a reasonable design choice 
for many microprograms (opcode 0x00 is often a NOP instruction for
many ISA-level designers).
<P>
Another approach would have been to designate some other location
as the first micro-instruction and require that a "fetch" happen
with PC 0x00000000 (and then another instruction to wait for the
fetch into the MBR to complete) before entering the main loop. 
Since many microprograms have similar increment/fetch loops, we
felt that it was reasonable to require that the PC be started at
0xFFFFFFFF as part of the hardware design.
<P>
Feedback on this item is particularly welcomed 
(<A HREF="mailto:rayo@ontko.com">rayo@ontko.com</A>).
<HR>
<A NAME="nopfirst"><B>Why is nop1 the first microinstruction, instead of 
Main1?</B></A>
<P>
In order for "goto(MBR)" to work when MBR contains the opcode for
<TT>NOP</TT>, the control store location 0x000 must contain the 
microinstruction "nop1".   This means that "Main1" must be at
some other location not used by one of the other opcodes, and that
if we wanted to start our execution of the microprogram at "Main1"
this location would have to be well known to the hardware designers
for the mic1 hardware.  Since we may want to be able to run other 
microprograms on the mic1 architecture, 
it seemed reasonable to pick control store location
0x000 as our starting address for all such microprograms.  
<P>
While any address would do as a starting location, 
this one seemed particularly appropriate, since
many microprograms might employ "goto(MBR)" and many ISA-level 
languages might employ opcode 0x00 as a NOP instruction.
<P>
Feedback on this item is particularly welcomed 
(<A HREF="mailto:rayo@ontko.com">rayo@ontko.com</A>).
<HR>

<A NAME="echonoerase"><B>Why doesn't the backspace key work in</B> 
<TT>echo.jas</TT><B>?</B>
<P>
Because the simulator output device (a Java TextArea) doesn't handle 
backspace characters.  It's hard to decide whether this is a feature or 
a limitation.  The "Standard Out" window is not meant to simulate
a cursor-addressable screen display, but only a serial device that 
displays the next printable character it receives.  
<P>
We <EM>could</EM>
modify the behavior of the standard output device to interpret
the backspace character as "delete the last character (if any)
on the current line in the output buffer", but we feel this 
would be more confusing an implementation of a simple output
device than one which ignores non-printable characters.
<HR>

<A NAME="debugmar"><B>Why does the debug frame show some addresses as 
word-addresses and others as byte-addresses?</B></A>
<P>
The MAR stores a number that is a <EM>word</EM> address (not a word-aligned
byte-address), and the PC stores a <EM>byte</EM> address.  This is specified
in Chapter 4, of Tanenbaum.  When the MAR is expressed on the memory bus,
it is at that point shifted by two bits.
