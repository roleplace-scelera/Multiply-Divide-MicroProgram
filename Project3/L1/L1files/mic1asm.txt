NAME
       mic1asm - mic1 microassembler


SYNOPSIS
       java mic1asm input-file output-file


DESCRIPTION
       mic1asm  reads a text input-file containing a microprogram
       in Mic-1 MicroAssembly  Language  (MAL),  and  produces  a
       binary  output-file  containing  the  corresponding  Mic-1
       microinstructions, suitable for  loading  into  the  Mic-1
       microarchitecture simulator, mic1sim.

       For example:

       java mic1asm mic1ijvm.mal mic1ijvm.mic1


       reads  mic1ijvm.mal  which  contains the text microprogram
       and produces the binary file mic1ijvm.mic1,  suitable  for
       loading into the mic1sim control store.

       The  Mic-1  microprogrammed  architecture  is described in
       Chapter 4 of  Andrew  S.  Tanenbaum,  Structured  Computer
       Organization, 4e, (Prentice-Hall, 1998).
