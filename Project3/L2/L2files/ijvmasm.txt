NAME
       ijvmasm - ijvm assembler


SYNOPSIS
       java ijvmasm input-file output-file


DESCRIPTION
       ijvmasm  reads  a  text input-file containing a program in
       the Integer Java Virtual Machine (IJVM) language, and pro-
       duces  a  binary  output-file containing the corresponding
       IJVM instructions, suitable for  loading  into  the  Mic-1
       microarchitecture simulator, mic1sim.

       For example:

       java ijvmasm test.ijvm test.iclass


       reads  test.ijvm  which contains the text program and pro-
       duces the binary file test.iclass,  suitable  for  loading
       into the mic1sim main memory.

       The  Mic-1  microprogrammed  architecture  is described in
       Chapter 4 of  Andrew  S.  Tanenbaum,  Structured  Computer
       Organization, 4e, (Prentice-Hall, 1998).




FILES
       ijvm.conf  contains the opcodes and instruction formats to
       be used by ijvmasm.




ENVIRONMENT
       The mic1 file classes.zip must be in your CLASSPATH.




BUGS
       None known.
